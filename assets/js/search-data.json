            "content": "I created this blog at the insistence of the fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders course. In an effort to Build in Public, I&#39;ll start by sharing my process of naming this blog and creating a logo. . I settled on the name strange attractors, a reference to mesmerizing structures that emerge in the evolution of certain dynamical systems, seemingly &quot;attracted&quot; the system along an unpredictable trajectory that nevertheless has a consistent structure. I first learned about these fascinating structures during my undergraduate research fellowship at the Santa Fe Institute, a research institute dedicated to the study of complex systems. . As a generalist with a wide range of interests, there&#39;s no way I could limit my personal blog to just a single topic. While dynamical systems will be just one theme among many here, the poetics of &quot;strange attractors&quot; appealed to me precisely because this blog is likely to be a scattered collection of thoughts and ramblings, hopefully, with the right initial conditions, self-organizing through the power of the Internet to enrich the lives of others. . The Lorenz Equations . First described by Edward Lorenz with assistance from Ellen Fetter, perhaps the most famous strange attractor emerges from this set of equations for certain initial conditions and values of the parameters $ sigma$, $ rho$, and $ beta$: . $$ frac{dx}{dt} = sigma ( y - x ) frac{dy}{dt} = rho x - y - xz frac{dz}{dt} = xy - beta z $$ Generating a Logo . Rather than just pulling a generic image of the Lorenz attractor to use as the logo and favicon for this blog, let&#39;s generate one using Python! . Since the Lorenz equations exhibit chaotic behavior, small changes to the initial conditions or parameters will generate a different plot. . _Note: the code below was adapted from this example in the matplotlib documentation._ . Generate Data . import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # This import registers the 3D projection, but is otherwise unused. from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D # noqa: F401 unused import def lorenz(x, y, z, s=10, r=28, b=2.667): &#39;&#39;&#39; Given: x, y, z: a point of interest in three dimensional space s, r, b: parameters defining the lorenz attractor Returns: x_dot, y_dot, z_dot: values of the lorenz attractor&#39;s partial derivatives at the point x, y, z &#39;&#39;&#39; x_dot = s*(y - x) y_dot = r*x - y - x*z z_dot = x*y - b*z return x_dot, y_dot, z_dot dt = 0.01 num_steps = 10000 # Need one more for the initial values xs = np.empty(num_steps + 1) ys = np.empty(num_steps + 1) zs = np.empty(num_steps + 1) # Set initial values xs[0], ys[0], zs[0] = (0., 1., 1.05) # Step through &quot;time&quot;, calculating the partial derivatives at the current point # and using them to estimate the next point for i in range(num_steps): x_dot, y_dot, z_dot = lorenz(xs[i], ys[i], zs[i]) xs[i + 1] = xs[i] + (x_dot * dt) ys[i + 1] = ys[i] + (y_dot * dt) zs[i + 1] = zs[i] + (z_dot * dt) . Plot in 3D . To capture the Lorenz attractor from the most compelling angle, . def plot(): fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.gca(projection=&#39;3d&#39;) plt.margins(0, 0, 0) ax.plot(xs, ys, zs, lw=0.4) ax.set_xlabel(&quot;X Axis&quot;) ax.set_ylabel(&quot;Y Axis&quot;) ax.set_zlabel(&quot;Z Axis&quot;) ax.set_axis_off() # Make the line multi-coloured by plotting it in segments of length s which # change in colour across the whole time series. s = 10 cmap = plt.cm.copper # Feel free to try out another colormap from here: https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html for i in range(0,num_steps-s,s): ax.plot(xs[i:i+s+1], ys[i:i+s+1], zs[i:i+s+1], color=cmap(i/num_steps), alpha=0.3) ax.view_init(elev=10, azim=140) . plot() . Save Plot as PNG . Logos and favicons tend to look best when they blend in with wherever they are placed, so we&#39;ll output a PNG with transparent background and minimal padding . plot() plt.savefig(&#39;logo.png&#39;, transparent=True, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;, pad_inches=0) . Now I have a slick custom logo that can easily be copied into my website&#39;s images directory and injected into my pages. . If you save a copy under favicon.ico then browsers will automatically make your site look legit with a tiny version of your logo on tabs and bookmarks! . Shameless fastpages plug . I&#39;ve got to say, the fastpages project is truly mind-blowing. Not only does it make deploying a personal blog free and practically effortless, the use of git and continuous deployment aligns well with my usual software engineering workflow. . If you&#39;re a coder looking for a simple blogging platform, definitely check out fastpages! .",

I am strangely attracted to: . complex systems | swing dancing | philosophy | data engineering | traditional jazz | fundamental physics | distributed systems | vintage fashion | investing | urban design | foraging | fermenting | cooking | feldenkrais method | . Purpose . Recently, I’ve been trying to reconnect with my childlike wonder at the physical world, and pick up the thread of my abandoned scientific and philosophical training. . After graduating from college with a double major in astrophysics and philosophy, I had initially planned to pursue a traditional academic careerpath: . PhD =&gt; postdoc =&gt; tenure . However, as I learned more about the trials and tribulations of academic success, I quickly became disenchanted with the pyramid scheme of tenure. I began to understand that there were too many PhD applying for too few positions for me to stand out without giving up the best years of my life and specializing to such an extent that I may lose touch with my generalist curiosity. . Instead, I went into the private sector, inadvertently ending up at the intersection of data science and DevOps, just as both fields took off. . This blog is my attempt to contribute some of my scant learnings back to the world, unburdened by the confines of academia, in whatever erratic form they happen to take. . Hopefully someone, at some point, finds value in these disjointed ramblings. . How It’s Made .
