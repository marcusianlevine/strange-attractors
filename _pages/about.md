Software architect by day, [hepcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_jive_talk) by night.

At heart, I'm a life-long learner. I spend my time cultivating my hobbies
and learning as much as possible.

I am strangely attracted to:

- complex systems
- swing dancing
- philosophy
- data engineering
- traditional jazz
- fundamental physics
- distributed systems
- vintage fashion
- investing
- urban design
- foraging
- fermenting
- cooking
- feldenkrais method

## Purpose

Recently, I've been trying to reconnect with my childlike wonder at the physical
world, and pick up the thread of my abandoned scientific and philosophical training.

After graduating from college with a double major in astrophysics and philosophy,
I had initially planned to pursue a traditional academic careerpath:

```
PhD => postdoc => tenure
```

However, as I learned more about the trials and tribulations of academic success,
I quickly became disenchanted with the pyramid scheme of tenure. I began to
understand that there were too many PhD applying for too few positions for
me to stand out without giving up the best years of my life and specializing
to such an extent that I may lose touch with my generalist curiosity.

Instead, I went into the private sector, inadvertently ending up at the
intersection of data science and DevOps, just as both fields took off.

This blog is my attempt to contribute some of my scant learnings
back to the world, unburdened by the confines of academia, in whatever erratic
form they happen to take.

Hopefully someone, at some point, finds value in these disjointed ramblings.
